## Homebrew Core
If your project is fairly popular, has at least 50 github stars, OR 20 watches OR 20 forks, see [Homebrew Core Template](brew-core.rb)

## Create your Own Tap
If your project is a bit less popular, or just starting out, you can create your own brew tap. See [Homebrew Tap Template](pkg/brew/brew-tap.rb)
